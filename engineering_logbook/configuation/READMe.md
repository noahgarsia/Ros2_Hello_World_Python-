# Configuation

The **Configuration** section documents how the system is structured and configured at the package level. It provides a clear summary of the configuration files used in the project, including how files are organised within each package and how they are connected through build and dependency definitions.

It Inlcudes:
1. Package configuration files such as package.xml
2. Build configuration files such as CMakeLists.txt
4. Any additional configuration files that control compilation, dependencies, or runtime behaviour

The purpose of this section is to make it easy for developers to understand what files exist, where they live, and how they work together to build and run the project correctly.
