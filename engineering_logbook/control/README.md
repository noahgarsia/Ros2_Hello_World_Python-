# Control

The **Control** section folder contains files for all development activity related to system behaviour, execution logic, and decision-making within the project.

This includes using information provided by perception or internal logic to determine what actions the system should take, such as publishing commands, managing timing, and controlling state or flow.

Control is responsible for deciding **how the system responds and behaves**, from the supplied raw data.
