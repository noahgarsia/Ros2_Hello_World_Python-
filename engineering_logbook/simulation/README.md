# Simulation

The **Simulation** section folder contains files for all development activity related to testing and validating system behaviour in a simulated environment.

This includes running the system without physical hardware, configuring simulation tools, and observing how control and perception components behave under controlled conditions.

Simulation may also include automated testing and validation activities such as unit or integration tests that are performed without real hardware.

Simulation is used to verify functionality, identify issues, and
understand system behaviour safely before deployment to real hardware.
