# Perception

The **Perception** section contains files for all development activity related to sensor data input, data processing, and data publishing used to represent and interpret the surrounding environment.

This includes handling raw sensor data, applying filtering or
transformations, and producing output information that describes what the system perceives.

Perception is responsible for providing meaningful information about the environment that the rest of the system can use, rather than deciding how the system should act.
